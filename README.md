# Simple-C-Data-Management-Case-Studies
A collection of three practical console-based management systems implemented in C, demonstrating proficiency with structures, arrays, string handling, and menu-driven logic.



This repository contains the source code and accompanying report for three console-based management systems implemented in the C programming language. These projects were developed as part of a course (PROGRAMMING FOR PROBLEM SOLVING / CSS_1001) to demonstrate fundamental C concepts, including structures, multi-dimensional arrays, string handling, and menu-driven application logic.


1. Smart Vehicle Parking & Revenue Management System

This simulation models a multi-floor parking facility (defined by FLOORS and SLOTS constants).

Features:

Parking/Entry: Assigns the first available slot across multiple floors.

Exit/Billing: Calculates parking duration and computes fees based on vehicle type (bike: ₹10/hr, car: ₹20/hr, truck: ₹30/hr).

Reporting: Generates an "End of Day Report" showing total revenue and parking usage percentage.

2. Digital Library with Fine & Recommendation

A system for managing a small library inventory.

Features:

Search: Locate books by title or author using keyword matching.

Issue/Return: Updates the number of copies available.

Fine Calculation: Calculates a penalty fine for late returns (e.g., ₹2 per late day).

Recommendation: Recommends books based on a user-specified genre.

3. Hostel Mess Billing & Attendance Tracker

A utility designed to track student mess attendance and calculate monthly bills.

Features:

Attendance Tracking: Allows marking daily attendance for multiple students.

Dynamic Billing: Calculates bills based on days attended (RATE is defined as ₹100/day).

Discount Logic: Automatically applies a 10% discount if a student is absent for more than 5 days (in the simulated 7-day month).

Payment Status: Tracks and reports students with unpaid bills.

Running the Projects

All projects are written in standard C (using stdio.h and string.h) and can be compiled using any standard C compiler (like GCC):



The accompanying PDF report, 251580052176_Yuhanth P_ Section U.pdf, provides detailed problem statements, algorithms, and sample input/output for each case study.
